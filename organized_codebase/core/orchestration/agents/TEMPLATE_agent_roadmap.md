## **üîç ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: FEATURE DISCOVERY PROTOCOL FOR AGENT [AGENT_NAME]**

### **üö® MANDATORY PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST - EXECUTE FOR EVERY SINGLE FEATURE**
**‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE implementing ANY feature - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

#### **üîç STEP 1: EXHAUSTIVE CODEBASE SEARCH FOR [SPECIALIZATION] FEATURES**
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: SEARCH EVERY PYTHON FILE FOR EXISTING [SPECIALIZATION] FEATURES
find . -name "*.py" -type f | while read file; do
  echo "=== EXHAUSTIVE [SPECIALIZATION] ANALYSIS: $file ==="
  echo "File size: $(wc -l < "$file") lines"
  # READ EVERY LINE MANUALLY - DO NOT SKIP
  echo "=== FULL FILE CONTENT ==="
  cat "$file"
  echo "=== SEARCHING FOR [SPECIALIZATION] PATTERNS ==="
  grep -n -i -A5 -B5 "[RELEVANT_KEYWORDS]" "$file"
  echo "=== CLASS AND FUNCTION ANALYSIS ==="
  grep -n -A3 -B3 "^class \|def " "$file"
done
```

#### **üîç STEP 2: CROSS-REFERENCE WITH EXISTING [SPECIALIZATION] MODULES**
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è SEARCH ALL [SPECIALIZATION]-RELATED FILES
grep -r -n -i "[FEATURE_CLASS_NAMES]" . --include="*.py" | head -20
grep -r -n -i "[SPECIALIZATION_KEYWORDS]" . --include="*.py" | grep -v "test" | head -20
```

#### **üîç STEP 3: DECISION MATRIX - EXECUTE FOR EVERY [SPECIALIZATION] FEATURE**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DECISION REQUIRED FOR EVERY [SPECIALIZATION] FEATURE:

1. Does this exact [specialization] functionality ALREADY EXIST?
   YES ‚Üí STOP - DO NOT IMPLEMENT
   NO ‚Üí Continue to step 2

2. Does a SIMILAR [specialization] feature exist that can be ENHANCED?
   YES ‚Üí Enhance existing feature (30% effort)
   NO ‚Üí Continue to step 3

3. Is this a COMPLETELY NEW [specialization] requirement?
   YES ‚Üí Implement new feature (100% effort) with comprehensive documentation
   NO ‚Üí Re-evaluate steps 1-2 more thoroughly

4. Can this [specialization] feature be BROKEN DOWN into smaller, existing pieces?
   YES ‚Üí Use composition of existing [specialization] features
   NO ‚Üí Proceed only if truly unique

5. Is there RISK OF DUPLICATION with any existing [specialization] system?
   YES ‚Üí STOP and use existing system
   NO ‚Üí Proceed with extreme caution
```

#### **üìã DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT**
**‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE writing ANY [specialization] code, create this document:**
```
Feature Discovery Report for: [FEATURE_NAME]
Timestamp: [CURRENT_TIME]
Agent: Agent [AGENT_NAME] ([Specialization])

Search Results:
- Files analyzed: [NUMBER]
- Lines read: [TOTAL_LINES]
- Existing similar [specialization] features found: [LIST]
- Enhancement opportunities identified: [LIST]
- Decision: [NOT_CREATE/ENHANCE_EXISTING/CREATE_NEW]
- Rationale: [DETAILED_EXPLANATION]
- Implementation plan: [SPECIFIC_STEPS]
```
