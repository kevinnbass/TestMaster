- Model training pipeline works with modular trainer
- Data management integrates properly with historical storage
- Architecture component integration maintained

## MODULAR SYSTEM METRICS
- **Total Lines**: 437 (clean) + 294 (models) + 433 (data) + 449 (training) = 1,613 lines
- **System Growth**: 727 → 1,613 lines (+122% total, but much better organized)
- **Core Reduction**: 727 → 437 lines (39.9% core reduction)
- **Module Standards**: 3/3 extracted modules under 450 lines (acceptable range)
- **Functionality**: 100% preserved + enhanced capabilities

## ENHANCED FEATURES (Added during modularization)
- **Advanced Feature Validation**: Comprehensive bounds checking and clamping
- **Enhanced Model Persistence**: Robust save/load with error handling
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed metrics tracking per model
