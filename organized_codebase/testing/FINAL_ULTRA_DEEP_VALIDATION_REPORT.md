## 🔧 TECHNICAL RESTORATION WORK

### Import Path Fixes Applied:
```python
# BEFORE (Broken)
from ..core.feature_flags import FeatureFlags
from ..core.shared_state import get_shared_state
from ..telemetry import get_telemetry_collector

# AFTER (Fixed)
from .feature_flags import FeatureFlags  
from .shared_state import get_shared_state
# Telemetry temporarily disabled - will be restored when consolidated
```

### Telemetry Integration:
- **Status**: Temporarily disabled to prevent import errors
- **Approach**: Added null checks (`if self.telemetry:`) to prevent crashes
- **Future**: Will be re-enabled when telemetry system is consolidated

### Core Module Structure Restored:
```
TestMaster/core/
├── __init__.py              # Core module exports
├── feature_flags.py         # ✅ RESTORED
├── shared_state.py          # ✅ RESTORED  
├── async_state_manager.py   # ✅ RESTORED
├── observability/           # Fixed imports
├── orchestration/           # Existing
└── tools/                   # Existing
```
