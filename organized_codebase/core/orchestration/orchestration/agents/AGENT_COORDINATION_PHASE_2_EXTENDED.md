- Components extracted: [X] 
- Unique features found: [X]

### Implementation Progress:
- New modules created: [X]
- Enhanced modules: [X]
- API endpoints added: [X]

### Performance Metrics:
- Speed improvements: [X]
- Memory optimization: [X]
- Scalability enhancements: [X]

### Integration Status:
- Cross-agent integration points: [X]
- API integrations completed: [X]
- Testing completed: [X]

### Quality Metrics:
- Test coverage: [X]%
- Documentation coverage: [X]%
- Code quality score: [X]

### Issues/Blockers:
- [List any problems encountered]

### Next 30-Minute Focus:
- [Specific planned work]
```

### Conflict Resolution Protocol
1. **File Conflicts:** IMMEDIATELY update AGENT_COORDINATION_PHASE_2_EXTENDED.md
2. **Feature Conflicts:** Agent A makes final architectural decisions
