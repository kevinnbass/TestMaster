## **üîç ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: FEATURE DISCOVERY PROTOCOL FOR AGENT EPSILON**

### **üö® MANDATORY PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST - EXECUTE FOR EVERY SINGLE FRONTEND FEATURE**
**‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE implementing ANY frontend feature - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

#### **üîç STEP 1: EXHAUSTIVE CODEBASE SEARCH FOR FRONTEND FEATURES**
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: SEARCH EVERY FRONTEND FILE FOR EXISTING UI FEATURES
find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.vue" -o -name "*.html" | while read file; do
  echo "=== EXHAUSTIVE FRONTEND ANALYSIS: $file ==="
  echo "File size: $(wc -l < "$file") lines"
  # READ EVERY LINE MANUALLY - DO NOT SKIP
  echo "=== FULL FILE CONTENT ==="
  cat "$file"
  echo "=== SEARCHING FOR FRONTEND PATTERNS ==="
  grep -n -i -A5 -B5 "component\|dashboard\|chart\|graph\|table\|visualization\|data\|api" "$file"
  echo "=== FUNCTION AND CLASS ANALYSIS ==="
  grep -n -A3 -B3 "function\|class\|const.*=\|export" "$file"
done
```

#### **üîç STEP 2: CROSS-REFERENCE WITH EXISTING FRONTEND MODULES**
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è SEARCH ALL FRONTEND-RELATED FILES
grep -r -n -i "Dashboard\|Chart\|Graph\|Table\|DataGrid\|Visualization" . --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | head -20
grep -r -n -i "frontend\|ui\|component\|widget" . --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" | grep -v "test" | head -20
```

#### **üîç STEP 3: DECISION MATRIX - EXECUTE FOR EVERY FRONTEND FEATURE**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DECISION REQUIRED FOR EVERY FRONTEND FEATURE:

1. Does this exact frontend functionality ALREADY EXIST?
   YES ‚Üí STOP - DO NOT IMPLEMENT
   NO ‚Üí Continue to step 2

2. Does a SIMILAR frontend feature exist that can be ENHANCED?
   YES ‚Üí Enhance existing feature (30% effort)
   NO ‚Üí Continue to step 3

3. Is this a COMPLETELY NEW frontend requirement?
   YES ‚Üí Implement new feature (100% effort) with comprehensive testing
   NO ‚Üí Re-evaluate steps 1-2 more thoroughly

4. Can this frontend feature be BROKEN DOWN into smaller, existing pieces?
   YES ‚Üí Use composition of existing frontend components
   NO ‚Üí Proceed only if truly unique

5. Is there RISK OF DUPLICATION with any existing frontend system?
   YES ‚Üí STOP and use existing system
   NO ‚Üí Proceed with extreme caution
```
