# AGENT ALPHA ROADMAP
**Created:** 2025-08-23 00:00:00
**Author:** Agent Alpha
**Type:** roadmap
**Swarm:** Greek
## API Cost Tracking & Semantic Analysis Specialist  
**Duration:** 500 Hours | **Focus:** API Cost Control, Code Intelligence, Backend Integration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PRACTICAL SCOPE OVERRIDE (Binding)

Read `swarm_coordinate/PRACTICAL_GUIDANCE.md`. Scope is a single-user, local tool. De-scope enterprise features (service discovery, API gateways, distributed tracing, message queues, gRPC, Elasticsearch/vector embeddings at scale, cluster HA, auto-scaling). Prefer simple, proven local components.

## ‚úÖ Protocol Compliance Overlay

- Frontend-first (ADAMANTIUMCLAD): Every deliverable must include a UI tie-in and visible status in the dashboard at `http://localhost:5000/`.
- Anti-regression (IRONCLAD/STEELCLAD/COPPERCLAD): Manual analysis before consolidation; extract unique functionality; verify parity; archive‚Äînever delete.
- Anti-duplication (GOLDCLAD): Run similarity search before creating new files; prefer enhancement; include justification if creation is necessary.
- Version control (DIAMONDCLAD): After task completion, update root `README.md`, then stage, commit, and push.

## üéØ Adjusted Success Criteria

- Deployment: Local workstation; no multi-user guarantees.
- Performance: p95 < 150ms for dashboard interactions; p99 < 500ms.
- Cost Control: Budget bands $5‚Äì$50/day; pre-execution warnings in UI; hard-stop at limit.
- Integration: 100% of Alpha‚Äôs implemented endpoints surfaced via unified API and visible on dashboard.
- Reliability: Local restart safety; JSON/SQLite state persisted.

## üîé Verification Gates (apply before marking any item complete)
1. UI component updated/added with visible state and error handling
2. End-to-end data flow documented (source ‚Üí API ‚Üí UI), incl. polling/WS cadence
3. Tests or evidence attached (unit/integration, screenshots, logs, or metrics)
4. History updated in `alpha_history/` with timestamp, changes, and impact
5. GOLDCLAD justification present for any new file
