**Created:** 2025-08-23 00:00:00
**Author:** Greek Coordinate
**Type:** roadmap
**Swarm:** Greek
## TestMaster Personal Codebase Analysis System

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: PRACTICAL SCOPE OVERRIDE**

**READ FIRST:** `swarm_coordinate/PRACTICAL_GUIDANCE.md` for realistic expectations.

**This master roadmap contains extensive unrealistic content including quantum computing, holographic displays, consciousness, reality manipulation, and grandiose claims. All agents should:**

1. **IGNORE unrealistic sections** and focus only on practical software development
2. **Follow the practical guidance** document for realistic scope and expectations  
3. **Build a personal tool** - no customers, no enterprise features, no industry disruption
4. **Use proven technologies** - no experimental or science fiction features

---

**Total Project Scope:** 2,500 hours (500 hours per agent)  
**Purpose:** Personal codebase analysis tool with good visualization
**Focus:** API cost control, performance monitoring, unified dashboard, APIs, frontend improvements
**Scale:** Single user, local deployment only
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-23 - Added practical scope override

## üéØ MISSION OVERVIEW

### Core Capabilities Integration
Building on documented achievements:
- **Agent Alpha:** API cost tracking system, semantic analysis engine, backend integration framework
- **Agent Beta:** Performance optimization pipeline, caching architecture, system monitoring
- **Agent Gamma:** Dashboard unification, visualization framework, user experience optimization
- **Agent Delta:** API surfacing & backend connectivity, headless validation testing, comprehensive API exposure
- **Agent Epsilon:** Frontend information richness & sophistication, advanced data visualization, intelligent user experience

### Success Criteria (Measurable & Achievable)
- **Deployment Target:** Local, single-user operation on developer workstation
- **Performance:** p95 < 150ms for dashboard interactions; p99 < 500ms
- **Cost Control:** API usage tracking with configurable daily budgets ($5‚Äì$50/day)
- **Scalability:** Not a goal (single-user scope); ensure smooth local operation
- **Integration:** 100% of implemented backend endpoints exposed via unified API layer
- **Reliability:** Local restart safety; configuration rollback checkpoints

## ‚úÖ Protocol Compliance Overlay (Binding)

- **Frontend-First (ADAMANTIUMCLAD):** Each deliverable must include a frontend integration subtask and verification that results are visible in the UI, with real-time status where applicable.
- **Anti-Regression (IRONCLAD/STEELCLAD/COPPERCLAD):** Manual analysis before consolidation; extract unique functionality; verify parity; archive‚Äînever delete.
- **Anti-Duplication (GOLDCLAD):** Similarity search before new files; prefer enhancement over creation; maintain justification blocks when creation is necessary.
- **Version Control (DIAMONDCLAD):** After task completion, update README.md with a brief summary, then stage, commit, and push with informative messages.

### Verification Gates (apply before marking any item complete)
1. Frontend connection verified and UI component created/updated
2. Data flow documented end-to-end, including polling/WS semantics
3. Test or validation evidence attached (metrics, screenshots, or logs)
4. History files updated (agent and coordinate) with timestamp and impact
5. Archive/creation justifications present where applicable
