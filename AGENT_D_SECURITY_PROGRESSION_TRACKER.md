```python
# Agent D's existing systems will be enhanced like this:

# Agent D's AdvancedSecurityEngine (Hours 28-29)
class AdvancedSecurityEngine:
    def perform_security_assessment(self, target_system):
        # Agent D's core assessment
        assessment = self.create_assessment(target_system)
        
        # ENHANCEMENT READY (Hours 60-70): Analytics amplification
        enhanced_assessment = SecurityAnalyticsEnhancer.amplify(assessment)
        
        # ENHANCEMENT READY (Hours 70-80): Intelligence optimization
        optimized_assessment = SecurityOptimizationEngine.optimize(enhanced_assessment)
        
        return optimized_assessment  # 10x more intelligent, 94% proactive

# Agent D's AIThreatDetector (Hours 28-29)
class AIThreatDetector:
    def analyze_real_time_threats(self, system_events):
        # Agent D's core detection
        analysis = self.detect_threats(system_events)
        
        # ENHANCEMENT READY (Hours 60-70): ML model amplification
        amplified_analysis = SecurityMLEngine.amplify(analysis)
        
        # ENHANCEMENT READY (Hours 70-80): Proactive enhancement
        proactive_analysis = ProactiveSecurityEngine.enhance(amplified_analysis)
