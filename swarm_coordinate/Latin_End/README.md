# Dashboard Consolidation Project
## Three-Agent Parallel Consolidation Initiative

### Project Status: ACTIVE
### Start Date: 2025-08-23
### Target Completion: 16 hours of parallel work

---

## Quick Start for Agents

### Agent X (Core Architecture)
```bash
cd swarm_coordinate/Dashboard_Consolidation/Agent_X/
# Read AGENT_X_ASSIGNMENT.md
# Start with Phase 1 in MASTER_CONSOLIDATION_ROADMAP.md
```

### Agent Y (Feature Enhancement)
```bash
cd swarm_coordinate/Dashboard_Consolidation/Agent_Y/
# Read AGENT_Y_ASSIGNMENT.md
# Start with Phase 1 in MASTER_CONSOLIDATION_ROADMAP.md
```

### Agent Z (Coordination & Services)
```bash
cd swarm_coordinate/Dashboard_Consolidation/Agent_Z/
# Read AGENT_Z_ASSIGNMENT.md
# Start with Phase 1 in MASTER_CONSOLIDATION_ROADMAP.md
```

## Current Phase: PHASE 1 - Analysis & Planning

### Phase Timeline
- ✅ Phase 0: Setup (Complete)
- 🔄 Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (Hours 0-2)
- ⏳ Phase 2: Core Consolidation (Hours 2-6)
- ⏳ Phase 3: Integration (Hours 6-10)
- ⏳ Phase 4: Modularization (Hours 10-12)
- ⏳ Phase 5: Unification (Hours 12-14)
- ⏳ Phase 6: Validation (Hours 14-16)

---

## Communication Protocol

### Handoff Directory
All agents communicate through `handoff/` directory using markdown files.

### File Naming Convention
```
AGENT_[X|Y|Z]_[PHASE]_[STATUS]_[YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_UTC].md
```

Examples:
- `AGENT_X_PHASE1_COMPLETE_20250823_120000_UTC.md`
- `AGENT_Y_PHASE2_BLOCKED_20250823_140000_UTC.md`
- `AGENT_Z_PHASE3_IN_PROGRESS_20250823_160000_UTC.md`

### Check Frequency
Every agent must check `handoff/` directory every 30 minutes.

---

## Core Protocols

### IRONCLAD (Consolidation)
- Read both files completely
- Identify more sophisticated file
- Extract unique features
- Manually merge
- Verify no loss
- Document everything

### STEELCLAD (Modularization)
- Files > 400 lines must be split
- Modules should be 50-250 lines
- Core engine < 250 lines
- Preserve ALL functionality

### COPPERCLAD (Archival)
- Never delete files
- Archive to `archive/` with timestamp
- Maintain restoration capability

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- 58 dashboard files → 1 unified system
- Core engine < 250 lines
- All modules < 400 lines
- Response time < 100ms
- 60+ FPS visualizations

### Qualitative
- Zero functionality lost
- Clean architecture
- Well documented
- Production ready

---

## Agent Responsibilities

### Agent X - Core Architecture
- 20 files assigned
- Building unified foundation
- Base: unified_dashboard_modular.py
- Focus: Core engine & visualization

### Agent Y - Feature Enhancement
- 19 files assigned
- Extracting advanced features
- Focus: Security, ML, Analytics
- Creating pluggable modules

### Agent Z - Coordination & Services
- 19 files assigned
- Unifying service layer
- Focus: WebSocket, APIs, Multi-agent
- Real-time coordination

## Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-08-23 | Use 3 parallel agents | Maximize efficiency |
| 2025-08-23 | X owns core architecture | Most critical component |
| 2025-08-23 | Epsilon as base | Most sophisticated modular design |
| 2025-08-23 | IRONCLAD + STEELCLAD | Ensure quality & modularity |

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Feature Loss | High | Low | IRONCLAD protocol |
| Integration Conflicts | Medium | Medium | Regular handoffs |
| Performance Issues | Medium | Low | Continuous testing |
| Bloated Files | Low | Medium | STEELCLAD protocol |

## Emergency Procedures

### If Blocked
1. Post BLOCKED status immediately
2. Detail blocker in handoff file
3. Other agents check for workarounds
4. Escalate if > 2 hours blocked

### If Conflict
1. Agent with more context owns decision
2. Document in handoff
3. Other agent adapts
4. Note in CONSOLIDATION_LOG

### If Feature Lost
1. STOP immediately
2. Post CRITICAL status
3. All agents verify
4. Rollback if needed

## Daily Standup Template

Each agent should post daily:
```markdown
# Agent [X|Y|Z] Daily Status

## Yesterday
- [What was completed]

## Today
- [What will be worked on]

## Blockers
- [Any impediments]

## Dependencies
- [What's needed from others]
```

## Success Celebration 🎯

When complete, we will have:
- **1** unified dashboard system
- **0** lost features
- **100%** test coverage
- **<100ms** response time
- **Production** ready system

Let's build something amazing!
