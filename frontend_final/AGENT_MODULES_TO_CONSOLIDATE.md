# Agent Modules Created in Wrong Location - Now Available for Consolidation

## Agent Z's Unified Services (moved from swarm_coordinate/)
**Location**: `services/unified_services_temp/`

### Files Available:
- `websocket_service.py` - Unified WebSocket implementation with <50ms latency optimizations
- `coordination_service.py` - Multi-agent coordination with status tracking
- `api_service.py` - Consolidated REST API endpoints
- `monitoring_service.py` - Real-time performance monitoring
- `unified_websocket_service.py` - Alternative WebSocket implementation

### CONSOLIDATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENT Z:
1. **Read each file in `services/unified_services_temp/`**
2. **Use IRONCLAD protocol to merge features INTO existing files:**
   - WebSocket features → `services/websocket_architecture_stream.py`
   - API features → `services/web_routes.py`
   - Monitoring features → `services/realtime_monitor.py`
   - Coordination features → `coordination/unified_cross_agent_dashboard.py`
3. **DELETE the temp directory after consolidation**

## Agent Y's Extracted Features (moved from swarm_coordinate/)
**Location**: `specialized/extracted_features_temp/`

### Files Available:
- `security/websocket_security_stream.py` - WebSocket security implementation
- `security/ml_threat_correlation.py` - ML-based threat detection
- `security/predictive_security_analytics.py` - Predictive security
- `security/vulnerability_scanner.py` - Security scanning
- `ml_intelligence/semantic_intent_classifier.py` - ML semantic analysis
- `ml_intelligence/ast_code_understanding.py` - AST-based code analysis
- `ml_intelligence/ml_performance_predictions.py` - Performance prediction
- `analytics/performance_aggregator.py` - Performance analytics

### CONSOLIDATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENT Y:
1. **Read each file in `specialized/extracted_features_temp/`**
2. **Use IRONCLAD protocol to merge features INTO existing files:**
   - Security features → `specialized/advanced_security_dashboard.py`
   - ML features → `specialized/enhanced_intelligence_linkage.py`
   - Analytics features → `specialized/performance_analytics_dashboard.py`
3. **DELETE the temp directory after consolidation**

## Goal: Use These As Building Blocks
These modules contain valuable extracted functionality that should be consolidated into the existing dashboard files using IRONCLAD protocol. They represent good feature extraction work that was placed in the wrong location.

**DO NOT keep these as separate modules - consolidate them into existing files!**
