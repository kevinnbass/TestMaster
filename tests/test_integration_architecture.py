"""
Architecture Integration Test - Phase 0 Hour 2
===============================================

Integration test to verify the three core architecture components
work together seamlessly for the modularization mission ahead.

Components tested:
- LayerManager + DependencyContainer integration
- ImportResolver + LayerManager integration  
- DependencyContainer + ImportResolver integration
- All three components working in harmony
