## ⚠️ CRITICAL COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

### **Agent X Dependencies:**
- **Core Integration:** All extracted features must plug into Agent X's unified dashboard base
- **Size Constraints:** Every module must remain < 200 lines (STEELCLAD compliance)
- **Architecture:** Features must be modular and independently deployable

### **Agent Z Dependencies:**
- **WebSocket Consolidation:** 4 WebSocket implementations need unification
- **Service Layer:** All real-time features need Agent Z's optimized services
- **Latency Requirements:** < 50ms performance targets for extracted features

### **Inter-Agent Coordination:**
- **Overlap Resolution:** Security monitoring overlaps (2 implementations)
- **Performance Standardization:** 3 different performance approaches need alignment
- **Template Consolidation:** Similar HTML patterns across files

---

## 📋 DUPLICATION ANALYSIS - COORDINATION REQUIRED

### **Major Overlaps Requiring Resolution:**
1. **WebSocket Streaming** → 4 implementations across files
2. **Security Monitoring** → 2 different approaches  
3. **Performance Metrics** → 3 different methodologies
4. **Dashboard Templates** → Similar HTML/CSS patterns

### **Recommended Resolution Strategy:**
- Agent Z: Consolidate all WebSocket implementations
- Agent Y + X: Merge security monitoring approaches  
- Agent X: Standardize performance metric collection
- All Agents: Create unified template system

---

## 🚀 PHASE 2 READINESS STATUS

- **Extraction Targets:** Prioritized (Security → ML → Analytics → Visualization)
- **Module Specifications:** Defined (38 modules, all < 200 lines)
- **Integration Points:** Mapped (Agent X + Z coordination points identified)

### ⏰ **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:**
1. **Agent X:** Begin core dashboard base preparation
2. **Agent Z:** Start WebSocket consolidation planning
3. **Agent Y (Me):** Begin Priority 1 security feature extraction
4. **Coordination:** Schedule Agent handoff review in 30 minutes
