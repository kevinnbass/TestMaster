## Coordination Protocol

### Status Updates
**Format:** `[TIMESTAMP] Agent [X]: [STATUS] - [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]`

### Task Claiming
**Format:** `[TIMESTAMP] Agent [X]: CLAIMING - [TASK_DESCRIPTION]`

### Completion Reports
**Format:** `[TIMESTAMP] Agent [X]: COMPLETED - [TASK] - [RESULTS/FILES_MODIFIED]`

### Conflict Resolution
- If agents work on overlapping areas, senior agent (Alpha) mediates
- Always document conflicts and resolutions
- Use git branches for major changes: `agent-[name]-[feature]`
