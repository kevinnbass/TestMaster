**Extraction Focus:**
- Advanced documentation generation beyond current AI-powered systems
- Sophisticated security vulnerability detection
- Comprehensive compliance and regulatory frameworks
- Advanced monitoring and alerting systems
- Interactive documentation and visualization tools

### 2. DOCUMENTATION EXCELLENCE ENHANCEMENT
**Advanced Documentation:**
- Enhanced AI-powered documentation with better context understanding
- Advanced API documentation with interactive examples
- Comprehensive architecture visualization and diagramming
- Real-time documentation updates and synchronization

**Knowledge Management:**
- Intelligent documentation search and discovery
- Context-aware documentation recommendations
- Documentation quality scoring and optimization
- Automated documentation maintenance

### 3. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE ENHANCEMENT
**Advanced Security:**
- Enhanced vulnerability scanning with ML-powered threat detection
- Advanced compliance checking for multiple frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, etc.)
- Sophisticated threat modeling and risk assessment
- Real-time security monitoring and incident response

**Enterprise Security:**

## File Ownership & Coordination

### Agent D Exclusive Files:
```
core/intelligence/documentation/
core/intelligence/security/
docs/ (all documentation)
security_configs/
compliance_reports/
```

### Coordination Rules:
- DO NOT modify core/intelligence/analysis/ (Agent A territory)
- DO NOT modify core/intelligence/ml/ or analytics/ (Agent B territory)
- DO NOT modify core/intelligence/testing/ (Agent C territory)
- Coordinate through security APIs for cross-system protection

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All advanced documentation features from archive integrated
- ✅ Comprehensive security scanning and compliance checking
- ✅ Real-time monitoring and alerting systems
- ✅ Interactive documentation and visualization tools
- ✅ Enterprise-grade security and compliance reporting

## Timeline: Complete within 3 hours
Priority: HIGH - Documentation and security are critical for production

## Communication Protocol
- Update PROGRESS.md every 30 minutes with security and documentation metrics
- Report documentation coverage and security scan results
- Coordinate with other agents for comprehensive system documentation
- Final deliverable: Complete security and documentation capability report
