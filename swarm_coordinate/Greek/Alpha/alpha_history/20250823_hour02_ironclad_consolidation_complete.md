## üìä FUNCTIONALITY EXTRACTION RESULTS

### ‚úÖ ALL UNIQUE FEATURES PRESERVED (9 Major Components):

1. **Endpoint Tracking System**
   - Added `endpoint` field to APICall dataclass
   - Added `calls_by_endpoint` and `cost_by_endpoint` statistics
   - Enables API endpoint performance analysis

2. **Agent-Specific Analytics**
   - Added `agent` field for Greek swarm tracking (alpha, beta, gamma)
   - Added `calls_by_agent` and `cost_by_agent` breakdown
   - Essential for multi-agent cost attribution

3. **Session Cost Tracking**
   - Added `session_calls` and `session_cost` to APIUsageStats
   - Tracks per-session usage separately from daily/hourly totals
   - Critical for development workflow monitoring

4. **Top Endpoints Analysis**
   - Implemented `get_top_endpoints()` method
   - Returns top 10 endpoints by cost with detailed metrics
   - Essential for identifying expensive API patterns

5. **Memory-Efficient Storage**
   - Added `recent_calls` deque with maxlen=10000
   - Efficient circular buffer for recent call history
   - Reduces memory usage for long-running sessions

6. **Global Convenience Functions**
   - `check_budget_before_call()` - Pre-execution budget validation
   - `get_usage_dashboard_data()` - Complete dashboard data export
   - `get_remaining_budget()` - Budget status summary
   - Maintains API compatibility with existing integrations

7. **Database Migration Support**
   - Automatic schema upgrade for existing databases
   - Handles addition of new columns to existing tables
   - Ensures backward compatibility with production data

8. **Request/Response Size Tracking**
   - Added `request_size` and `response_size` fields
   - Enables bandwidth and payload analysis
   - Critical for API performance optimization

9. **Enhanced Statistics Output**
   - Extended statistics with all new breakdowns
   - Maintains compatibility while adding new dimensions
   - Complete dashboard integration support
