## 🚀 **HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS**

### **1. SWARM ORGANIZATION**
- **Greek Swarm**: 3 agents (Alpha, Beta, Gamma) + Greek Coordination
- **Latin Swarm**: 5 agents (A, B, C, D, E) + Latin Coordination  
- **Cross-Swarm**: Inter-swarm collaboration (e.g., Alpha + A,B,C)

### **2. ROADMAP LIFECYCLE**

#### **A. Roadmap Creation**
1. **Choose Template**: Use appropriate template from swarm_coordinate/
   - `TEMPLATE_main_roadmap.md` for coordinate/main roadmaps
   - `TEMPLATE_agent_roadmap.md` for individual agent roadmaps

2. **Apply Dating Rules**: 
   - Filename: `20250122_roadmap_name.md`
   - Header metadata with creation date and time

3. **Customize Template**:
   - Replace all `[PLACEHOLDER]` text with specific information
   - Add agent-specific specializations and objectives
   - Define coordination requirements and dependencies

4. **Place in Correct Directory**:
   - Agent roadmaps → `[Greek|Latin]/[Agent]/[agent]_roadmap/`
   - Coordination roadmaps → `[Greek|Latin]/Coordinate/[coordinate]_roadmap/`
   - Cross-swarm roadmaps → `Swarm/swarm_roadmap/`

5. **Update CLAUDE.md**: Add minimal reference (max 3 lines) to new roadmap

#### **B. Task Execution**
1. **Individual Task Completion**:
   - Agent completes assigned task from roadmap
   - Updates file in respective `[agent]_history/` directory
   - Documents achievement with timestamp and description

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Regular updates to individual history files
   - Coordination through designated communication channels
   - Issue escalation when blockers encountered

#### **C. Roadmap Completion**
1. **Verification Process**:
   - Read every line of roadmap to verify completion
   - Compare to current codebase state
   - Check agent's individual session memory for confirmation

2. **Archival Process**:
   - Move completed roadmap to `[agent]_past_roadmap/` directory
   - Add achievements to appropriate coordinate history
   - Update collective swarm accomplishments

### **3. COORDINATION MECHANISMS**

#### **Intra-Swarm Coordination**
- **Greek Agents**: Alpha, Beta, Gamma coordinate through Greek/Coordinate/
- **Latin Agents**: A, B, C, D, E coordinate through Latin/Coordinate/
- **Shared History**: Individual histories feed into coordinate history

#### **Inter-Swarm Coordination**  
- **Cross-Swarm Projects**: Use Swarm/ directory for collaboration
- **Targeted Collaboration**: Specific agent combinations (e.g., Alpha + A,B,C)
- **Flexible Coordination**: Adaptable to project requirements

### **4. REAL-TIME MONITORING AND COORDINATION**

#### **Agent Dashboard**
- **Location**: Built into the codebase as real-time monitoring system
- **Purpose**: Live view of all agent progress, coordination status, and system health
- **Access**: Agents can reference dashboard for current system state
- **Integration**: Dashboard reflects coordination activities and progress

#### **Ongoing Coordination Channels**
- **Cross-Swarm**: `Swarm/swarm_ongoing/` - Information essential for all agents across swarms
- **Greek Coordination**: `Greek/Coordinate/greek_coordinate_ongoing/` - Information essential for Greek swarm agents
- **Latin Coordination**: `Latin/Coordinate/latin_coordinate_ongoing/` - Information essential for Latin swarm agents
- **Usage**: Agents write markdown files with information other agents need to know
- **Format**: Timestamped markdown files with clear, actionable information

#### **Periodic Check Requirements**
**Every 2 Hours (Minimum):**
- Own roadmap and history directories for current status
- Swarm coordination roadmap for team objectives
- Swarm ongoing directory for new coordination information

**Every 4 Hours (Minimum):**
- Cross-swarm roadmap and ongoing directories
- Conflict directory for issues affecting your work

**On Task Completion:**
- Immediately update own history
- Check dependent agents' histories
- Share critical information in appropriate ongoing directory

#### **Conflict Resolution Logging**
- **Location**: `conflict/` directory
- **Purpose**: Agents log coordination issues, conflicts, and resolutions
- **Format**: Markdown files with timestamp, agents involved, issue description, resolution
- **Process**: Log conflict → Work toward resolution → Document outcome

### **5. HISTORY AND DOCUMENTATION**

#### **Individual Agent History**
- Location: `[agent]_history/` directories
- Content: Task completions, timestamps, achievements
- Purpose: Track individual agent progress and contributions

#### **Coordinate History**
- Location: `[coordinate]_history/` directories  
- Content: Collective swarm achievements derived from individual histories
- Purpose: Track swarm-wide progress and coordination success

#### **Cross-Swarm History**
- Location: `Swarm/swarm_history/`
- Content: Inter-swarm collaboration outcomes
- Purpose: Track cross-swarm coordination and integration

## 📋 **MANDATORY PROTOCOLS**

### **🔒 IRONCLAD Protocol Compliance**
All roadmaps and coordination efforts must adhere to IRONCLAD anti-regression consolidation rules:
- Manual LLM analysis required for all consolidation activities
- Complete functionality preservation mandatory
- Iterative verification until perfect consolidation achieved

### **🛡️ STEELCLAD Protocol Compliance**  
All modularization efforts must follow STEELCLAD anti-regression modularization rules:
- Manual LLM breakdown and verification required
- Perfect functionality mirroring between parent and child modules
- Iterative process until absolute functionality preservation

### **🥉 COPPERCLAD Protocol Compliance**
All file removals must follow COPPERCLAD anti-deletion archival rules:
- No files ever deleted - always archived
- Complete preservation in timestamped archive directories
- No exceptions to archival process

## 🎯 **COORDINATION BEST PRACTICES**

### **1. Communication**
- **Regular Updates**: Maintain consistent progress reporting
- **Clear Documentation**: Document all decisions and rationale
- **Issue Escalation**: Promptly escalate blockers and conflicts

### **2. Integration**
- **Code Coordination**: Ensure compatible code changes across agents
- **Testing Alignment**: Coordinate testing efforts to avoid conflicts
- **Documentation Sync**: Keep all documentation current and consistent

### **3. Quality Assurance**
- **Template Usage**: Always use provided templates for consistency
- **Protocol Compliance**: Strictly adhere to all three protocols
- **Verification**: Thoroughly verify all completions before archival

## 🚨 **COMMON COORDINATION SCENARIOS**

### **Scenario 1: Individual Agent Roadmap**
1. Agent receives assignment through CLAUDE.md reference
2. Agent accesses roadmap in their respective directory
3. Agent follows roadmap phases and updates history
4. Upon completion, roadmap moves to past_roadmap directory

### **Scenario 2: Swarm Coordination**
1. Coordinate roadmap created in appropriate Coordinate/ directory
2. Multiple agents work collaboratively on shared objectives
3. Individual progress tracked in agent histories
4. Collective progress tracked in coordinate history

### **Scenario 3: Cross-Swarm Collaboration**
1. Cross-swarm roadmap created in Swarm/ directory
2. Agents from different swarms collaborate on specific objectives
3. Progress tracked in both individual and cross-swarm histories
4. Coordination facilitates knowledge transfer between swarms

### **Scenario 4: Ongoing Information Sharing**
1. Agent discovers important information (new pattern, issue, solution)
2. Agent creates timestamped markdown file in appropriate `*_ongoing/` directory
3. Other agents regularly check ongoing directories for new information
4. Information helps prevent duplicate work and coordination conflicts

### **Scenario 5: Conflict Resolution**
1. Agent A and Agent B both need to modify the same file
2. Agent A logs conflict in `conflict/20250122_file_modification_conflict.md`
3. Agents work together to determine resolution (merge, sequence, split)
4. Resolution documented in same conflict file for future reference
5. Coordination information shared in appropriate ongoing directory

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Issue: Template Placeholders Not Replaced**
- **Solution**: Ensure all `[PLACEHOLDER]` text is replaced with specific information
- **Prevention**: Use templates as starting point, not final product

### **Issue: Incorrect Directory Placement**  
- **Solution**: Move roadmap to correct directory based on type and swarm
- **Prevention**: Review directory structure before placement

### **Issue: Missing History Updates**
- **Solution**: Retroactively update history files with completed tasks
- **Prevention**: Update history immediately upon task completion

### **Issue: Coordination Conflicts**
- **Solution**: Use escalation process defined in individual roadmaps
- **Prevention**: Maintain regular communication and progress updates
