## ‚ö†Ô∏è **PRACTICAL SCOPE OVERRIDE**

**READ FIRST:** `swarm_coordinate/PRACTICAL_GUIDANCE.md` for realistic expectations.

**This roadmap contains some unrealistic content that should be ignored. Focus on:**
- **Unified dashboard** combining all system components in one clean interface
- **Basic charts and graphs** using standard libraries (Chart.js, D3.js basics)
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile  
- **Simple navigation** between different views and data
- **No holographic displays, VR/AR, or "transcendent" visualizations**

**Personal use scale:** Single user, local deployment, proven technologies only.

---

**Focus:** Dashboard unification, data visualization, user interface design
**Timeline:** 500 Agent Hours  
**Execution:** Independent with coordination with other agents

## **üîç ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: FEATURE DISCOVERY PROTOCOL FOR AGENT GAMMA**

### **üö® MANDATORY PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST - EXECUTE FOR EVERY SINGLE DASHBOARD FEATURE**
**‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE implementing ANY dashboard feature - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

#### **üîç STEP 1: EXHAUSTIVE CODEBASE SEARCH FOR DASHBOARD FEATURES**
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: SEARCH EVERY FRONTEND FILE FOR EXISTING DASHBOARD FEATURES
find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.vue" -o -name "*.html" | while read file; do
  echo "=== EXHAUSTIVE DASHBOARD ANALYSIS: $file ==="
  echo "File size: $(wc -l < "$file") lines"
  # READ EVERY LINE MANUALLY - DO NOT SKIP
  echo "=== FULL FILE CONTENT ==="
  cat "$file"
  echo "=== SEARCHING FOR DASHBOARD PATTERNS ==="
  grep -n -i -A5 -B5 "dashboard\|chart\|graph\|visualization\|navbar\|sidebar\|component" "$file"
  echo "=== FUNCTION AND CLASS ANALYSIS ==="
  grep -n -A3 -B3 "function\|class\|const.*=\|export" "$file"
done
```

#### **üîç STEP 2: CROSS-REFERENCE WITH EXISTING DASHBOARD MODULES**
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è SEARCH ALL DASHBOARD-RELATED FILES
grep -r -n -i "Dashboard\|Chart\|Graph\|Visualization\|Component" . --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | head -20
grep -r -n -i "dashboard\|ui\|interface\|visualization" . --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" | grep -v "test" | head -20
```

#### **üîç STEP 3: DECISION MATRIX - EXECUTE FOR EVERY DASHBOARD FEATURE**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DECISION REQUIRED FOR EVERY DASHBOARD FEATURE:

1. Does this exact dashboard functionality ALREADY EXIST?
   YES ‚Üí STOP - DO NOT IMPLEMENT
   NO ‚Üí Continue to step 2

2. Does a SIMILAR dashboard feature exist that can be ENHANCED?
   YES ‚Üí Enhance existing feature (30% effort)
   NO ‚Üí Continue to step 3

3. Is this a COMPLETELY NEW dashboard requirement?
   YES ‚Üí Implement new feature (100% effort) with comprehensive testing
   NO ‚Üí Re-evaluate steps 1-2 more thoroughly

4. Can this dashboard feature be BROKEN DOWN into smaller, existing pieces?
   YES ‚Üí Use composition of existing dashboard components
   NO ‚Üí Proceed only if truly unique

5. Is there RISK OF DUPLICATION with any existing dashboard system?
   YES ‚Üí STOP and use existing system
   NO ‚Üí Proceed with extreme caution
```
