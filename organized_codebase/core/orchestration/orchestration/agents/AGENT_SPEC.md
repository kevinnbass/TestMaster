# üìã **AGENT STATUS & CONFIGURATION SYSTEM SPECIFICATION**
**Human Documentation - System Overview and Usage Guide**

**Created:** 2025-08-23 23:15:00  
**Purpose:** Human-readable documentation of agent profile system  
**Audience:** System administrators and human users  

---

## **üéØ SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

The Agent Status & Configuration System provides controlled agent discovery and collaboration through a two-file profile system for each of the 10 autonomous agents (5 Greek, 5 Latin).

### **Key Benefits**
- **Controlled Discovery**: Agents can discover each other's capabilities without accessing private internal files
- **Access Control**: Explicit directory permissions prevent unauthorized access and context bleed  
- **Collaboration Framework**: Structured process for agents to enlist each other's help
- **Status Transparency**: Real-time visibility into agent progress and availability
- **Context Isolation**: Prevents agents from reading each other's private roadmaps and histories

---

## **üìÅ FILE SYSTEM STRUCTURE**

### **Agent Profile Files (Per Agent)**
Each agent has exactly two profile files in their directory:

```
swarm_coordinate/Greek/Alpha/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AGENT_CONFIG_ALPHA.md    # READ-ONLY (444) - Immutable configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AGENT_STATUS_ALPHA.md    # READ-WRITE (644) - Dynamic status
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alpha_handoff/           # Individual handoff directory
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ incoming/            # Handoffs received from other agents
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ processed/           # Archived processed handoffs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alpha_history/           # Private agent history (forbidden to others)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ alpha_roadmap/           # Private agent roadmap (forbidden to others)
```

### **All 10 Agents Have This Structure**
- **Greek**: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon  
- **Latin**: A, B, C, D, E

## **üîí AGENT_CONFIG_[AGENT].md - READ-ONLY CONFIGURATION**

### **Purpose**
Contains immutable agent profile, access permissions, and system rules that should never change.

### **Key Sections**
1. **Immutable Agent Profile**: Agent ID, swarm, specialization, roadmap location
2. **Communication Channels**: Handoff directories, history, coordination paths
3. **Access Permissions**: Allowed directories, forbidden directories, tool restrictions
4. **Discovery Rules**: How to find and collaborate with other agents
5. **Timing Guidance**: When to check other agents, when not to explore

### **File Permissions**
- **chmod 444** (read-only for everyone)
- **Prevents accidental modification** of critical system configuration
- **Only system administrators can modify** (requires chmod change)

### **What Agents Can Learn**
- Which directories they can and cannot access
- How to find other agents for collaboration
- What tools they're allowed to use
- Communication channel locations

---

## **üìä AGENT_STATUS_[AGENT].md - READ-WRITE DYNAMIC STATUS**

### **Purpose**  
Contains real-time, agent-updated information about current progress, availability, and collaboration status.

### **Key Sections**
1. **Current Progress**: Active phase, completion percentage, current tasks
2. **Collaboration Status**: Availability level, response time expectations
3. **Skills & Capabilities**: Skills offered, skills needed, expertise areas
4. **Active Collaborations**: Current partnerships and their status
5. **Recent Achievements**: Completed milestones and accomplishments
6. **Upcoming Milestones**: Planned work and timeline estimates
7. **Communication Preferences**: Contact methods and working style

### **File Permissions**
- **chmod 644** (read-write for agent, read-only for others)
- **Agents update every 2 hours** as specified in framework
- **Other agents can read for collaboration discovery**

### **What Agents Can Learn About Each Other**
- Current availability and workload
- Skills they can offer to help others
- Skills they need help with
- Preferred communication and collaboration style
- Recent achievements and upcoming work

---

## **ü§ù COLLABORATION WORKFLOW**

### **Discovery Process**
1. **Agent A** reads other agents' STATUS files to see who's available
2. **Agent A** identifies an agent with needed skills or complementary work
3. **Agent A** checks the target agent's availability level and communication preferences

### **Enlistment Process**  
1. **Agent A** sends a COLLAB handoff to **Agent B**'s `[agent]_handoff/incoming/` directory
2. **Agent B** receives and reviews the collaboration proposal
3. **Agents exchange handoffs** to negotiate terms and scope
4. **Both agents update their STATUS files** with collaboration details
5. **Agents coordinate work** through the enhanced handoff system

### **Handoff System**
- **Individual Directories**: Each agent has `[agent]_handoff/incoming/` and `processed/`
- **Structured Messages**: Using enhanced handoff templates with priorities and types
- **Response Tracking**: Acknowledgment and completion tracking
- **Archive Process**: Move processed handoffs to `processed/` directory

---

## **üö´ ACCESS CONTROL & SECURITY**

### **What Agents CAN Access**
- **Own directory**: Full read-write access to their own files
- **Other agents' STATUS/CONFIG files**: Read-only access for collaboration discovery
- **Other agents' handoff incoming**: Write-only access to send collaboration proposals
- **Shared coordination directories**: Swarm-wide coordination and handoff areas

### **What Agents CANNOT Access**
- **Other agents' history files**: Private progress logs and internal work
- **Other agents' roadmap files**: Detailed plans and internal strategy
- **Master roadmap files**: Comprehensive system roadmaps (prevents context bleed)
- **Archive directories**: Historical records and backups

### **Context Bleed Prevention**
The system prevents agents from accidentally gaining knowledge of other agents' detailed work by:
- **Explicit directory restrictions** in config files
- **File system permissions** preventing unauthorized access  
- **Tool limitations** preventing broad system searches
- **Forbidden directory lists** with clear reasoning

---

## **üîÑ UPDATE PROTOCOLS**

### **Agent Responsibilities**
- **Update STATUS file every 2 hours** during active work
- **Check other agents' STATUS files every 60 minutes** for collaboration opportunities
- **Process incoming handoffs within response time commitments**
- **Update collaboration status when starting/ending partnerships**

### **Human Administrator Responsibilities**
- **Monitor file permissions** (config files should remain 444, status files 644)
- **Verify directory structure integrity** periodically
- **Review collaboration patterns** for system optimization
- **Update CONFIG files only when system architecture changes**

---

## **üìà SYSTEM MONITORING**

### **Health Indicators**
- **File Permissions**: Config files remain read-only (444), status files read-write (644)
- **Directory Structure**: All agents have proper handoff directories
- **Update Frequency**: Status files show recent timestamps (within 2-4 hours)
- **Collaboration Activity**: Handoff directories show active agent cooperation

### **Common Issues & Solutions**
- **Permissions Changed**: Restore with `chmod 444 AGENT_CONFIG_*.md` and `chmod 644 AGENT_STATUS_*.md`
- **Missing Directories**: Recreate `[agent]_handoff/incoming/` and `processed/` directories
- **Stale Status Files**: Agents not updating - check if they're following the 2-hour update protocol
- **Context Bleed**: Agents accessing forbidden directories - review and enforce config restrictions

---

## **üîß MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES**

### **Daily Checks**
- Verify file permissions remain correct
- Check status file update timestamps
- Review active collaborations in status files

### **Weekly Reviews**  
- Analyze collaboration patterns and effectiveness
- Check handoff directory activity levels
- Verify access control compliance

### **Monthly Updates**
- Review and update CONFIG files if system architecture changes
- Archive old handoff files if directories become cluttered
- Update templates if new collaboration patterns emerge

---

## **üéØ SUCCESS METRICS**

### **System Health**
- All 10 agents have properly configured profile files
- Status files updated regularly (within 2-hour windows)
- No unauthorized access to forbidden directories
- Active collaboration through handoff system

### **Collaboration Effectiveness**
- Agents discovering and enlisting each other successfully
- Reduced duplication of work through skill sharing
- Faster completion of complex tasks through agent cooperation
- Clear communication and coordination through handoff system

**This system creates a controlled, secure environment for autonomous agent collaboration while preventing context bleed and maintaining clear boundaries between agents' private work and collaborative capabilities.**
