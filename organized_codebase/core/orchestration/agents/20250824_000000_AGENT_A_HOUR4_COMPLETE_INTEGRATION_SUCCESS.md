**Integration Status:**
```json
{
  "layer_manager": "completed",
  "import_resolver": "completed", 
  "dashboard_connection": "completed",
  "template_migration": "completed",
  "production_activation": "completed"
}
```

### **2. Dashboard Architecture Monitor Created**
**File:** `web/dashboard/architecture_monitor.py` (445 lines)

**Dashboard Features:**
- Real-time architecture health visualization
- Layer compliance monitoring
- Dependency health tracking
- Import success rate metrics
- HTML widget generation for dashboard integration
- API response formatting for service integration

### **3. Architecture Health Validation Results**
```
Architecture Health: 66.67%
Layer Compliance: 100.00%
Dependency Health: 100.00%
Import Success: 0.00% (expected - no imports attempted yet)
```
