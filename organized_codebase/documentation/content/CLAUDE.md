## 🚨 EMERGENCY LATIN_END SWARM INSTRUCTIONS (TEMPORARY)

### CRITICAL: WORK WITH EXISTING FILES ONLY

**FOR ALL LATIN_END AGENTS (X, Y, Z):**

#### ❌ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
- **DO NOT CREATE NEW MODULES** in swarm_coordinate/ directories
- **DO NOT CREATE unified_services/ directories**
- **DO NOT WRITE new .py files** unless explicitly consolidating existing ones
- **DO NOT CREATE new feature modules** - extract into existing files

#### ✅ REQUIRED ACTIONS:
- **WORK DIRECTLY WITH** existing files in `web/dashboard_modules/`
- **USE IRONCLAD PROTOCOL** to consolidate existing dashboard files
- **Agent X**: Consolidate INTO `web/dashboard_modules/core/unified_dashboard_modular.py`
- **Agent Y**: Extract features INTO existing most sophisticated files
- **Agent Z**: Consolidate services INTO `web/dashboard_modules/services/websocket_architecture_stream.py`
- **READ IMMEDIATELY**: `web/dashboard_modules/AGENT_MODULES_TO_CONSOLIDATE.md` for your accidentally created modules that are now available for consolidation

#### 🎯 GOAL: 58 EXISTING FILES → 1 UNIFIED SYSTEM
**NOT**: 58 files + 58 new files = 116 files ❌

#### CONSOLIDATION COMPLETION PROTOCOL:
**MANDATORY IRONCLAD + COPPERCLAD PAIRING:**

For EACH file consolidation:
1. **IRONCLAD Phase**: Extract functionality to consolidated target
2. **VERIFICATION Phase**: Run 3-step validation algorithm
3. **COPPERCLAD Phase**: Archive only after verification complete

**5-STEP BULLETPROOF VALIDATION ALGORITHM:**

**Step 1: Complete Inventory**
- Read ENTIRE source file line by line (no skipping)
- Document EVERY: function, class, variable, import, constant, configuration, comment with TODO/FIXME
- Include line numbers and signatures
- Create `EXTRACTION_MANIFEST_[filename].md`

**Step 2: Exact Code Verification** 
- For each extracted item, compare EXACT code (character-by-character)
- No "logical equivalence" assumptions - code must be identical or explicitly documented differences
- Verify imports, dependencies, module-level variables are preserved
- Document any modifications with justification

**Step 3: Context Preservation Check**
- Verify module-level initialization, global variables, import paths preserved
- Check if extracted code depends on original module context
- Test extracted functionality in isolation AND in integrated context
- Document context dependencies

**Step 4: Integration Testing**
- Run original file's functionality and record outputs/behavior
- Run consolidated target with same inputs and compare outputs EXACTLY
- Test error conditions, edge cases, performance characteristics
- Any differences = FAILURE, return to extraction

**Step 5: Dependency Impact Analysis**
- Search codebase for imports/references to original file
- Verify all external dependencies still work with consolidated target
- Test that removing original file doesn't break anything
- Only pass if zero external impact

**COPPERCLAD ARCHIVAL - Only After Complete Validation:**
- Archive to `archive/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_UTC_ironclad_[filename]/`
- Include `EXTRACTION_MANIFEST_[filename].md` in archive
- Document restoration commands in `ARCHIVE_LOG.md`

**STRAGGLER DETECTION ALGORITHM:**
For cleanup of potentially missed files:
1. **Grep search**: Find duplicate function/class names across remaining files
2. **Line-by-line comparison**: Compare similar functions for uniqueness
3. **Dependency analysis**: Check if any remaining files import/depend on each other
4. **Manual review**: Agent must read ANY file before archiving (no assumptions)

#### VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:
Any agent creating new files instead of consolidating existing ones is **VIOLATING GOLDCLAD PROTOCOL** and must immediately stop and redirect to existing file consolidation.

**DELETE THIS SECTION AFTER LATIN_END COMPLETION**

### Project Scope
This is a personal development project for building a codebase analysis platform for individual use. Focus is on personal productivity and learning, not enterprise scaling or commercial deployment.

### Definitions & Rubrics - Appendix A

#### Core Terminology
- **FUNCTIONALITY**: Any code behavior, including functions, classes, constants, default parameters, logging, error handling, configuration settings, and lines affecting execution.
- **SOPHISTICATED FILE**: File with recent modification date, high test coverage, good documentation, low cyclomatic complexity, and comprehensive error handling.
- **PARENT MODULE**: Original large file before modularization.
- **CHILD MODULE**: Derived file from parent module sections.
- **ARCHIVE**: Timestamped preservation in `archive/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_UTC_description/` with restoration capability.

#### File Sophistication
Select the file with the richest and most relevant feature set. Consolidation will merge any missing features.

#### Tool Authorization Matrix
| Tool Type | Analysis | Comparison | Modification | Archive | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Read | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Required before decisions |
| Grep | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | For search/pattern analysis |
| Diff | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | For visual comparison; no auto-patch |
| Edit | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | For manual code modifications |
| Write | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | For new file creation |
| Move | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | For archive operations |
| Scripts | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Forbidden for all operations |

### Universal Prohibitions
- No scripts for modification or consolidation decisions.
- No automated extraction; use Read/Edit tools for functionality extraction.
- No deletions; use COPPERCLAD archival for removals.
- No exceptions to protocols.
- No assumptions without verification; verify file contents.
- No manual commits; use DIAMONDCLAD automation for version control.
- No local-only changes; push all changes to GitHub via DIAMONDCLAD.
- No modifications to read-only directories: cloned repositories (`AWorld/`, `AgentVerse/`, etc.), `archive/` and subdirectories.

## ADAMANTIUMCLAD Frontend Connectivity Protocol

### Rule #1: Frontend-First Development (All Agents)
For every task:
<Left blank.>

### Rule #2: Frontend Integration Verification
Before completing task:
- Verify output accessible to frontend.
- Confirm UI component created/updated.
- Ensure data flow established.
- Confirm real-time status on frontend.
- Ensure user can interact with results via interface.

### Rule #3: Non-Frontend Tasks (Exceptions)
Skip frontend integration only for:
- Internal architecture restructuring.
- Archive operations without active functionality impact.
- Build/deploy tasks without user data.
- Internal security measures.
- Include exemption block:
  ```text
  FRONTEND EXEMPTION JUSTIFIED: [timestamp UTC]
  TASK: [description]
  EXEMPTION REASON: [reason]
  FUTURE INTEGRATION PLAN: [plan]
  AGENT: [identifier]
  ```

### Rule #4: Frontend-Task Integration Priority Matrix
Prioritize tasks by frontend potential:
- **High**: Immediate frontend capability.
- **Medium**: Minor adaptation needed.
- **Low**: Complex/indirect connection.
- **Deferred**: Significant architecture changes required.
- **Exempt**: Justified per Rule #3.

### Rule #5: Swarm Coordination Enhancement
Emphasize frontend in coordination:
- Prioritize agents with frontend capabilities.
- Include frontend status in updates.
- Coordinate on shared frontend components.

### Rule #6: Dashboard Enhancement Mandate (GOLDCLAD Integration)
When working on dashboards:
- Enhance existing dashboards; do not create new ones.
- Identify most sophisticated dashboard as merge target.
- Consolidate functionality into most advanced dashboard.
- Use search commands to find existing implementations:
  ```bash
  find . -name "*.html" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.vue" | grep -i dashboard
  grep -r "dashboard\|chart\|graph\|visualization" --include="*.js" --include="*.py" --include="*.html"
  ```
- **Decision Matrix**:
  - **Existing found**: Enhance most sophisticated.
  - **None found**: Create new.
  - **Multiple**: Consolidate into most advanced via IRONCLAD.

Measure success by user-visible frontend improvements.

**Core Principle**: All work should enhance user-facing frontend; justify if not.

### PowerShell on Windows Environment
- **Operating System**: Windows with PowerShell
- **Shell**: PowerShell (not bash, zsh, or other Unix shells)
- **Command Syntax**: Use PowerShell cmdlets and syntax
- **Path Separators**: Use backslashes (\) for Windows paths
- **Environment Variables**: Use $env:VARIABLE syntax
- **Command Chaining**: Use semicolon (;) or separate lines instead of && and ||
- **File Operations**: Use PowerShell cmdlets like Get-ChildItem, Copy-Item, etc.
- **Process Management**: Use Start-Process, Get-Process cmdlets
- **Text Processing**: Use PowerShell's string methods and Where-Object
- **Script Execution**: Use .ps1 files and PowerShell execution policy

### PowerShell-Specific Patterns
- **Directory Navigation**: `cd`, `Set-Location`, `Push-Location`
- **File Listing**: `Get-ChildItem` (not ls)
- **File Copying**: `Copy-Item` (not cp)
- **File Moving**: `Move-Item` (not mv)
- **File Removal**: `Remove-Item` (not rm)
- **Directory Creation**: `New-Item -ItemType Directory` (not mkdir)
- **Text Search**: `Select-String` (not grep)
- **Process Listing**: `Get-Process` (not ps)

### Avoid These Linux/Unix Commands
- ❌ `ls` → ✅ `Get-ChildItem` or `dir`
- ❌ `cp` → ✅ `Copy-Item`
- ❌ `mv` → ✅ `Move-Item`
- ❌ `rm` → ✅ `Remove-Item`
- ❌ `mkdir` → ✅ `New-Item -ItemType Directory`
- ❌ `grep` → ✅ `Select-String`
- ❌ `find` → ✅ `Get-ChildItem -Recurse`
- ❌ `&&` → ✅ `;` or separate commands
- ❌ `||` → ✅ PowerShell error handling
- ❌ `/path/to/file` → ✅ `C:\path\to\file` or `.\\path\\to\\file`
- ❌ `chmod` → ✅ Not needed in PowerShell
- ❌ `chown` → ✅ Not needed in PowerShell

### PowerShell Best Practices
- Use full cmdlet names for clarity
- Use PowerShell's object pipeline
- Leverage PowerShell's error handling with try/catch
- Use PowerShell modules and cmdlets
- Avoid aliases in scripts for clarity
- Use PowerShell's built-in help with Get-Help
