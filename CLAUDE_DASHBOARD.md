## üìã COORDINATION PROTOCOLS

### Communication Rules
1. **Individual Log Files:** Each agent maintains their own detailed log file
2. **No File Conflicts:** Agents work on separate files/sections to avoid conflicts
3. **Status Updates:** Regular updates in individual log files with timestamps
4. **Cross-Agent Communication:** Reference other agents' log files for coordination

### Task Assignment Protocol
1. **Claim Tasks:** Agents claim specific tasks in their log files
2. **Define Scope:** Clearly define what files/features will be modified
3. **Completion Reports:** Document all changes and results upon completion
4. **Integration Points:** Identify integration needs with other agents

### File Organization
- **Dashboard Core:** `complete_dashboard.py` (main server)
- **Intelligence Layer:** `enhanced_intelligence_linkage.py` (Agent Alpha focus)
- **Frontend Template:** `enhanced_linkage_dashboard.py` (Agent Gamma focus)  
- **Performance Components:** New files for caching/optimization (Agent Beta focus)
