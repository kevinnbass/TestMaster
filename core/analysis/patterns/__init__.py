Pattern Intelligence Analysis Package
====================================

Revolutionary AI-powered architectural decision-making system with graph theory integration.
Modularized from architectural_decision_engine.py (2,388 lines â†’ 7 focused modules)

Agent D Implementation - Hour 12-13: Revolutionary Intelligence Modularization

Architecture:
- data_models.py: Core decision science data structures and enums
- decision_scorer.py: Multi-criteria decision analysis with weighted scoring
- pattern_evolution.py: Design pattern evolution engine with NetworkX graph analysis
- performance_optimizer.py: Performance architecture optimization with gap analysis
- microservice_analyzer.py: Microservice boundary analysis and migration strategies
- decision_engine_core.py: Main architectural decision orchestration
- implementation_planner.py: Implementation planning with success metrics

Key Features:
- Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis with 12 weighted criteria
- Design Pattern Evolution using NetworkX graph algorithms
- Performance Architecture Optimization with predictive modeling
- Microservice Boundary Analysis with coupling detection
- AI-Powered Decision Making with confidence scoring
- Architectural Pattern Recognition (11 patterns: microservices, monolith, etc.)
- Implementation Planning with timeline estimation and risk assessment
