# Autonomous High-Reliability Code Compliance Sandbox

This sandbox contains a complete copy of the reorganization system designed for testing and developing the autonomous high-reliability code compliance harness.

## 🚀 Purpose

This sandbox allows you to:
- Test the autonomous compliance harness in isolation
- Experiment with different configurations
- Develop and refine the autonomous system
- Ensure changes don't affect the main codebase

## 📁 Structure

- **Core Reorganization System**: All the files from `tools/codebase_reorganizer/`
- **Autonomous Compliance Harness**: `autonomous_compliance_harness.py`
- **Compliance Rules Engine**: `compliance_rules_engine.py`
- **Test Scripts**: `test_autonomous_harness.py`

## 🧪 Testing the Autonomous System

### Quick Test (No Advanced Model Required)
```bash
python test_autonomous_harness.py
```

This will demonstrate:
- The compliance rules engine (working component)
- The multi-agent architecture design
- The state machine workflow
- Self-healing capabilities

### Full Autonomous Test (Requires GLM-4.5)
```python
from autonomous_compliance_harness import run_autonomous_compliance_harness

result = await run_autonomous_compliance_harness(
    target_directory=".",  # Test on sandbox itself
    target_compliance=0.95,
    max_iterations=50
)
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The autonomous system supports extensive configuration:

```python
config = create_compliance_harness_config(
    model_name="glm-4.5-flash",
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=4096,
    safety_thresholds={
        'max_consecutive_failures': 3,
        'max_error_rate': 0.5,
        'max_fixes_per_cycle': 3,
        'max_iterations': 100,
        'timeout_hours': 1
    }
)
```

## 🤖 Multi-Agent System

The autonomous harness uses 5 specialized agents:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Main controller managing workflow
2. **Analyzer Agent**: Identifies compliance violations
3. **Fixer Agent**: Generates compliant code fixes
4. **Validator Agent**: Verifies fix quality and compliance
5. **Healer Agent**: Self-healing and error recovery

## 📊 State Machine Workflow

```
INITIALIZING → ANALYZING → IDENTIFYING_ISSUES → GENERATING_FIXES
     ↓                    ↓
SELF_HEALING ←────────────┘
     ↓
VALIDATING_FIXES → CHECKING_PROGRESS → ANALYZING (repeat)
     ↓
COMPLETED ←─── (when 100% compliance achieved)
```

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- **Bounded Loops**: All iterations have fixed upper bounds
- **Pre-allocated Memory**: No dynamic resizing after initialization
- **Low Temperature**: Consistent code generation (temperature=0.1)
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery from failures
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents infinite loops
- **Progress Monitoring**: Continuous status reporting

## 🎯 NASA-STD-8719.13 Compliance Rules

The system enforces 8 critical compliance rules:

1. **Function Size Limit** (60 lines max)
2. **Dynamic Object Resizing** (pre-allocated only)
3. **Fixed Upper Bounds** (bounded loops only)
4. **Parameter Validation** (assert statements)
5. **Type Hints** (mandatory annotations)
6. **Complex Control Flow** (explicit loops preferred)
7. **Module Size Limit** (300 lines max)
8. **External Dependencies** (vetted packages only)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Test the Rules Engine**:
   ```bash
   python -c "
   from compliance_rules_engine import compliance_engine
   from pathlib import Path
   report = compliance_engine.analyze_codebase(Path('.'))
   print(f'Violations Found: {report.total_violations}')
   print(f'Compliance Score: {report.compliance_score:.1%}')
   "
   ```

2. **Run the Architecture Demo**:
   ```bash
   python test_autonomous_harness.py
   ```

3. **Experiment with Configurations**:
   - Modify safety thresholds in `create_compliance_harness_config()`
   - Adjust agent behaviors in the `AgentCapabilities` class
   - Test different state machine transitions

## 🧪 Development Workflow

1. **Make Changes**: Edit files in the sandbox
2. **Test Changes**: Run `test_autonomous_harness.py`
3. **Validate Rules**: Use `compliance_rules_engine.py` to check compliance
4. **Iterate**: Refine the autonomous system based on test results

## 📈 Progress Tracking

The autonomous system provides detailed progress reporting:
- Compliance score over time
- Violations remaining by category
- Fixes applied per iteration
- Error rates and self-healing events
- Performance metrics

## 🔄 Integration with Main Codebase

When ready, changes from the sandbox can be integrated back:
1. Test thoroughly in sandbox
2. Validate with compliance rules engine
3. Copy working components to main codebase
4. Run full compliance audit

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Fix Syntax Errors**: Complete the autonomous compliance harness
2. **Add Model Integration**: Implement GLM-4.5 or equivalent
3. **Test Autonomous Loop**: Verify the self-directed improvement
4. **Add Production Safety**: Implement timeout and error handling
5. **Create Documentation**: Comprehensive user guide
